# Reflective Hybrid AI Model for Judicial Operational Threat Intelligence

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation, datasets, and experimental configurations for the research paper:

**"A Reflective AI-Driven Middleware Model for Real-Time Operational Threat Intelligence: Enabling Co-Adaptive Detection and Response in Judicial Systems"**

*Submitted to: Springer Nature Journal*

The system implements a novel reflective, co-adaptive AI architecture that dynamically reconfigures threat detection and response mechanisms in real-time, specifically designed for judicial cybersecurity environments.
